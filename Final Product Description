Device Overview: Fishies – Interactive Aquatic Game

Fishies is an interactive aquatic game designed to engage children in swimming through real-time, competitive play. Each robotic fish is equipped with advanced motion control and interactive features to create an engaging experience.

The fish is powered by two motor-driven fans, protected by safety covers, and a jet motor connected to a water pump for controlled propulsion. A servo-controlled tail, attached via a hinge, allows directional movement. The main body, vacuum-foamed and waterproofed with plastic, houses the internal electronics, including a rechargeable battery pack and a mini Arduino, which serves as the core controller for the motors, LEDs, and interactive components.

A multicolor LED embedded in each fish changes between red and blue based on player interaction. Players press a waterproof button, conveniently attached to a flexible silicone fin, to toggle their team’s color. The casing of the fish is 3D-printed, ensuring a fun and recognizable design while maintaining durability in water.

By integrating digital interactivity with physical movement, Fishies introduces a novel approach to aquatic play, combining technology, competition, and skill development in an immersive swimming experience.
