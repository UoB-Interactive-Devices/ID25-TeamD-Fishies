- Fish swims underneath you, to set pace
    - either swims (fins and tail kinda wagging vibe)
    - or wheels and fan - along the floor of the pool, then hits the wall and turns/can go both ways
        - two propellers for multi directional movement
- communicates via
    - either bluetooth
    - or a headset
    - or bubbles?
    - lights underwater
- have cameos of celebrities/voices you want speaking to you while you swim.
    - music or motivation
- can connect to apple watch/fitbit
    - can tell you to take a break when heartrate is too high or if anything is wrong
